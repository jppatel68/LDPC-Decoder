# LDPC-Decoder
Designed and developed an LDPC decoder for AWGN channels, implementing both Hard Decision and Soft Decision decoding techniques.
Used graph theory concepts such as bipartite graphs and adjacency matrices to structure LDPC parity-check constraints. Applied mathematical principles from probability theory. Developed and tested the simulation in MATLAB.
